## Supported Sites For Scene Scraping

This list is meant to keep track of which sites are already supported by existing community scrapers. And which scrapers support them. When introducting a new scraper, add the sites your scraper supports to this list in your PR. Please keep the site list in alphabetical order to keep the list tidy. If you are adding a lot of sites to the list, it may be useful to paste the sites in and then use a tool [like this](https://wordcounter.net/alphabetize) to alphabetize it.
