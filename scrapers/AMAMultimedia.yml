# This one convers a LOT of sites (including the PornPros Network). Almost
# all the sites follow the same structure, making this mega scraper possible.
# I got the list of sites from here: https://www.thebestporn.com/review_company.html?id=2085

# Note: The brands associated directly with the PornPros network, require you
# get a scene link from PornPros.com directly, as the individual sites do not
# have scene links. These sites are:
# publicviolations.com jurassiccock.com 18yearsold.com 40ozbounce.com
# cockcompetition.com crueltyparty.com cumshotsurprise.com deepthroatlove.com
# disgraced18.com eurohumpers.com flexiblepositions.com freaksofboobs.com
# freaksofcock.com pimpparade.com shadypi.com squirtdisgrace.com

# There are a small number of sites where the scene links don't exist on
# PornPros.com OR their own sites, and are not supported. These are:
# amateurviolations.com cumdisgrace.com lolcumshots.com massagecreep.com
# milfhumiliation.com webcamhackers.com
