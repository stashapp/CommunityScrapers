  # The movie section is kinda weird. The movies seems like they are made after the scenes.
  # e.g. they don't seem to have front/back covers, and are basically just a compilation
  # of some scenes they released with same theme? 
  # So a movie has date as the earliest released scene, and other scenes have their own.
  # Description is just name of the 'movie', so gonna go with whole 'desc & cat' as synopsis.
  # So i'd say movies on TransSensual aren't 'proper'. But here goes:
